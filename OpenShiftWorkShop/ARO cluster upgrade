# To view available cluster version
oc adm upgrade

# Select an appropriate version
export OCP_VERSION= '4.10.43"

# Run this command to upgrade to a specific version
oc adm upgrade --to=${OCP_VERSION}


Monitor Upgrade:

Cluster operators : Watch the cluster operators roll, one by one, the 'machine-config' operator roll is last. When this occurs , watch the machine config pool statuses

#watch cluster operator and machine config pool
watch -n5 "oc get co | sort -brk 2,4; echo ""; oc get mcp"

Expected Result: version for each cluster operator slowly progress to the specified target version, it is complete when all items in the version column = 4.10.xx. all items in the AVAILABLE column = true and all items in the progressing and Degraded Column = False.

!note: Wait until all cluster operator namespace

oc get events -n openshift-cluster-version
oc -n openshift-cluster-version logs pod <podname>
oc get events -n openshift-etcd-operator
