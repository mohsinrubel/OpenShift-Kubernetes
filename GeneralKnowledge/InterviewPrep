What is the difference between Docker and kubernetes?
>>> Docker is a container platform and kubernetes is a container orchestration platform
>>> Docker is designed to building and running single container and kubernetes is a system, where group VMs that are combined together to form a cluster

What is the main components of kubernetes architecture?
kubernetes has two main components:
>>> The Control Plane: 
- manage the kubernetes cluster
- This is main nerve centre of each cluster
- This is responsible for ensuring that the kubernetes cluster attains a desired state, defined by the user in a declarative manner

>>> Worker nodes     : Can be virtual or physical machine, a node hosts pods, which run one or more cotainers


Here are the main componnent of the control Plane:
1. Kube -apiserver: 
- provides an API that serves as the front end of a kubernetes control Plane
- responsible for handling external and internal requests
- Determing wheather is request is valid and then processing internal

2. Kube-scheduler: 
- Responsible for scheduling pods on specific nodes according to automated workflows and user defined conditions
, which can nclude resource requests, concerns like affinity and taint or tolerations, priority, persistant volumes and more

3. Kube-controller manager: 
- this is a control lopp that monitors and regulates the state of kubernetes cluster
- this receives information about the current state of the cluster and objects within internal
- This control manager is responsible for several controllers that handle various automated activities at the cluster or pod level, including replication controller, namespace controller , service accounts controller, deployment, statefulset ad daemonset

4. etcd : 
- A key value database that contains data about your cluster state and configuration.
ETCD is fault tolerent and distributed.

5. Cloud-controller-manager:
- This is specific to the cloud provider, not required for on-premises kubernetes environments
- This component can embed cloud specific control logic, for example, it can access the clound provider load balancer service, enable to connect a kubernetes cluster with the API of a cloud provider

Here are the main component of worker nodes:
1. Nodes:
- This is physical or VM that can run pods as part of kubernetes cluster.
- A cluster can scale up 5000 nodes, to scale cluster capacity, you can add more nodes

2. pods
- This is considered the samllest unit in kubernetes
- Each pod consists of one or more tightly coupled containers. and configurations how containers should run
- Pod contains at least one container
