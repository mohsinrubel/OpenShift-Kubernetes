How does networking work if there's more than one container? ðŸ‘‡

First, let's talk about what Pods do. A Pod has a very important job, which is to run one or more containers.

Each Pod has one IP address and it receives that IP address via the Container Network Interface (CNI).

Even if there's more than one container in the Pod, it has only one IP address.

If there's only one IP address and multiple containers, how can k8s resources communicate with the containers? Via Ports.

Even though the containers have the same exact IP address, they have different ports, and that's how other k8s resources can reach them.
