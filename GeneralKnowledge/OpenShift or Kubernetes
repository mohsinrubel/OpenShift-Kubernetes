Kubernetes lacks built-in capabilities for autheticatication and authorization.

- Login is easier in Openshift using console but kubernetes dashboard must be installed separately.

- Sacling is simple by using openshift but the addition of VM in kubernetes takes a long time, it necessitates the creation of YAML scripts by developers
